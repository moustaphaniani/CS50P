# Program that:
#
# 1. Prompts the user for a level, n.
#    If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
# 2. Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = ,
#    wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with n digits.
#    No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# 3. Prompts the user to solve each of those problems.
#    If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again,
#    allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem.
#    If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
# 4. The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
